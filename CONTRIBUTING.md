# Contributing to Github Readme Stats

Thanks for your interest in contributing. We want this to be friendly, clear,
and low-friction for everyone.

## Ways to contribute

- Report a bug or regression.
- Propose a feature or improvement.
- Pick up a [top-voted issue](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats/issues/1935) and send a PR.
- Help with reviews or documentation.

## How we prioritize work

We use the [Top Issues dashboard](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats/issues/1935) to track community demand and prioritize what
we work on. If you care about an issue, please add a reaction and comment. We
generally focus on the most upvoted items first.

## Issues first, then assignments

For most work, please open an issue before starting:

1. Create or find the issue.
2. Ask to be assigned in a comment.
3. Wait for a maintainer to assign you before starting work.

This helps us avoid duplicated effort and align on scope.

## Pull request workflow

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from the default branch.
2. Keep changes focused and scoped to the issue.
3. Add tests or update docs where appropriate.
4. Open a PR and link the issue it resolves.

If your change affects a specific repository, please also read and follow that
repo's contribution guidelines.

## Backporting to upstream

We do our best to backport improvements to
`https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats`. Some changes may be
fork-only when the projects diverge or when upstream is not ready to accept the
change.
